Weather Analysis using SQLite
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to review a dataset pertaining to weather conditions that has been stored in a SQLite database to provide information that will convince an investor that opening up a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii is a good business idea. The idea is that the shop will sell surf boards and ice cream throughout the year, but the investor is hesitant because he invested in a similar business that failed due to the weather conditions. In order to get this investor on board, we need to provide statistical analysis specifically on the weather conditions in Oahu that will convince him that this will be a successful business venture.
